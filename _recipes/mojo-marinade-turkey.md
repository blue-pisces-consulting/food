## Ingredients
Serves: 10

* 12-14 lbs whole turkey thawed, neck & giblets removed
* 6 cloves garlic peeled
* 1 teaspoon salt plus more for the skin
* 1/2 teaspoon oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper plus more for the skin
* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil plus more for the skin
* 1/4 cup sour orange juice store-bought or juice from 1 orange and 1/2 lemon

## Steps
Prep time: 45 minutes

Cook time: 1 hour 30 minutes; 20 minutes resting

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
2. In a mortar and pestle, mash garlic, salt, oregano, cumin, and pepper together until you get a paste. Transfer to a bowl and combine the garlic mojo marinade with the oil and sour orange juice. Set aside.
3. To spatchcock (aka butterfly) the turkey, place the thawed turkey, breast-side down, on a cutting board or baking sheet. Make sure it's sturdy so you don't hurt yourself in this process. Run your hand along the center of the bird to find the backbone. Using a pair of very sharp kitchen shears, cut as close to the spine as possible, one side at a time. You may have to use both your hands to cut through the ribs. Once the backbone is cut out, you can save it for homemade gravy. Now, turn the turkey over, breast-side up, and using both hands, one on top of another, press down firmly on the breast until you hear a crack.  
4. Transfer the now flattened, spatchcocked turkey to a baking sheet with a wire rack.
5. Rub the garlic mojo marinade inside and under the skin of the turkey. Pat the skin dry with a paper towel, brush it with olive oil and season with a bit of salt and pepper. Tuck the wing tips behind the turkey breast to prevent them from burning.
6. Place the turkey in the oven and roast for 1 1/2 hours (90 minutes) until browned and cooked through. The internal temp should be 165ÂºF using a food thermometer. 
7. Remove the turkey from the oven and let it rest for 20 minutes before carving. 
8. Enjoy!
