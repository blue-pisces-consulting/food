# Tostones

![Tostones](/images/tostones-one.jpg)

## Ingredients
Serves: 4

* 2 large green plantains, peeled and sliced in 2” slices
* 1/2-1 cup of oil (enough to cover the slices). I like peanut oil but vegetable oil or avocado oil would work. Anything with a high smoke point.
* Salt to taste

## Steps
Prep time: 5 minutes
<br>
Cook time: 15 minutes

1. In a deep nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat.
2. Add the thick plantain slices in the skillet, making sure there is enough oil to cover the slices. You want enough oil where the very top of the plantains are still visible but the rest of the slice is cooking in the oil.
3. Fry slices for about 5 minutes on all sides. Remove and drain on paper towels to absorb the excess oil.
4. Using a paper towel folded over, smash the plantains to about 1/2 inch thick. (they make plantain presses if you want to be fancy)
5. Fry the smashed plantains for about 4-5 minutes in the same skillet until golden brown on both sides.
6. Remove and drain on paper towels and season with salt. (You can transfer the oil to an airtight container and reuse it at a later time, if you’d like)
