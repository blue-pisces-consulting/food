# Blue Pisces Food Recipe Library

No matter how you got here, you're in the right place! This is where the Blue Pisces team stores recipes we've shared so others can try them out!

## Adding a recipe
1. Create a new branch using the Jira ID from the Food project and recipe name following the format in this example: FOOD-1: Stuffed Chicken
2. Use your Jira ID in front of every commit message you'll make (e.g. FOOD-1: Added stuffed chicken image)
3. Upload an image of your recipe in the `/images` folder, take note of the file name
4. Copy the contents of the `example.md` file
5. Add a file in the `/recipes` folder and paste the contents of `example.md` into it
6. Name your new file to the name of your dish with `.md` extension
7. Enter in your recipe information and add the image file name from step 2
8. Open a pull request named using the Jira ID and recipe name (same as step 1, take care of the formatting)
9. Enter any info you want in the pull request body
10. Merge to main when you're ready using squash merging

## Changing a recipe
 
1. Follow the same Jira ID steps on any commits, branches, and pull requests as when adding a recipe
2. Make edits to the file
3. If it isn't yours, commit changes to a new branch and start a pull request to main (if it's yours, just merge to main)
4. Ask the owner of the recipe to review your pull request and they can decide to squash merge it
